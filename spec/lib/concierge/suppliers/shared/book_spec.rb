# Shared example for supplier client's book method.
#
# Some context variables required:
#
#   supplier_client:     An instance of the client being tested. `#quote` will be called on this
#
#   success_params:      Arguments for `#quote` in the happy case.
#                        Assertions will be made on `supplier_client.quote(success_params)`
#
#   successful_code:     The returned successful reservation reference, asserted against the value returned from `book`
#
#   error_params_list:   A collection of arguments for `#quote` when some error occurs.
#                        For each item p, assertions will be made on `supplier_client.quote(p)`
