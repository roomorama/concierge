  # +Concierge::EmergencyLog+
  #
  # This class writes to a log file when a situation considered as an emergency
  # happens. Data logged to this file should be used to aid in debugging in error
  # situations, recoverable or not.
  #
  # Usage
  #
  #   log = Concierge::EmergencyLog.new
  #   begin
  #     dangerous_operation!
  #   rescue Some::Error => err
  #     event = Concierge::EmergencyLog::Event.new
  #     event.type = "network_error"
  #     event.description = "something went wrong when connecting to some service"
  #     event.messages = e.backtrace
  #
  #     log.report(event)
  #   end
  #
  # Logged messages are kept under +log/emergency_log.{env}+, where +env+
  # is the Hanami environment.
