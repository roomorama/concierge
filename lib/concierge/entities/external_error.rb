# +ExternalError+

# This entity corresponds to an external error that happened to Concierge while performing
# its task. The definition of external error is everything that is outside of Concierge's
# control, such as:
#
# * problems on supplier's services
# * network failures
# * bugs on supplier responses
# * invalid JSONs being returned back
# * missing response fields in supplier response payloads
#
# In any of these cases, the error should be persisted as an external error
# so that it can be analysed by a human later. This is the puprose of this
# class.
