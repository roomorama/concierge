# +Credentials+
#
# This class manages credentials for interacting with protected supplier APIs.
# Credentials are stored in the +config/credentials+ directory, in YML files
# named after the running environment. Therefore, in a +staging+, credentials
# will be loaded from a +config/credentials/staging.yml+ file.
#
# See YML files under that directory to understand how credentials are stored.
# Note that production credentials should *always* be stored in environment
# variables.
#
# Usage
#
#   Credentials.for("Supplier")
#   # => Struct(username="roomorama" password"p4ssw0rd")
class Credentials

  # +Credentials::MissingSupplierError+
  #
  # This is raised when validating credentials and there is no information found
  # for a given supplier.
  class MissingSupplierError < StandardError
    def initialize(supplier)
      super(%<No credential information for supplier "#{supplier}">)
    end
  end

  # +Credentials::MissingCredentialError+
  #
  # This is raised when validating credentials and one of the required credentials
  # is either not defined or empty.
  class MissingCredentialError < StandardError
    def initialize(supplier, missing_credential)
      super(%<Missing credential "#{missing_credential}" for supplier #{supplier}>)
    end

    # Parses the content of the credentials file and caches it at the class level to avoid
    # keeping the same content on every instance.

      @_data ||= begin
        config_path = Hanami.root.join("config", "credentials", [Hanami.env, "yml"].join("."))

    # Makes sure that the given set of credentials exist when the application boots.
    #
    # Usage:
    #
    #   Credentials.validate_credentials!({
    #     "supplier"      => %w(username password),
    #     "othersupplier" => %w(access_token)
    #   })
    #
    # This will raise exceptions in case the required credentials are
    # not defined or empty. This ensures that when the application boots,
    # all required credentials are properly set up.
