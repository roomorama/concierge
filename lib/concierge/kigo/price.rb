module Kigo

  # +Kigo::Price+
  #
  # This class wraps the logic belonging to the process of getting the price of a stay
  # for a Kigo property. Such calculation is performed by calling the +computePricing+
  # API call offered by Kigo's API.
  #
  # A +request_handler+ and a +response_parser+ can be injected to this class to provide
  # different behavior. The goal is for the same logic to be applied interchangeable between
  # Kigo's new API and Kigo's Legacy API, since both are active and handle different sets of
  # properties at the moment. The default request and response handlers deal with Kigo's
  # new API - i.e., custom behavior is necessary for Kigo's Legacy API.
  #
  # Usage
  #
  #   price = Kigo::Price.new(credentials)
  #   price.quote(params)
  #   # => #<Result error=nil value=Quotation>
