module SAW
  # +SAW::Importer+
  #
  # This class wraps supplier API and provides data for building properties.
  #
  # `SAW::Importer` returns properties and countries.
  # There are corresponsing PORO-entities which describe these domain models.
  #
  # A `SAW::Entities::DetailedProperty` object is different from the
  # `SAW::Entities::BasicProperty` object and we can't say that one of them is
  # a full version of the property and the second one is a light version
  # because there are some attributes which present in `BasicProperty` but
  # missed in `DetailedProperty` and vise versa.
  #
  # Usage
  #
  #   importer = SAW::Importer.new(credentials)
  #   importer.fetch_countries
  #   importer.fetch_properties_by_country(country)
  #   importer.fetch_properties_by_countries(countries)
  #   importer.fetch_detailed_property(property_id)
  #   importer.fetch_unit_rates_by_property_ids(property_ids)
  #   importer.fetch_all_unit_rates_for_properties(properties)

    # SAW API requires country/cityregion information for its search method.
    # There is also an endpoint which returns all properties, but we can't use
    # it since it includes `On Request` properties and we would end up with the
    # solution when we have to deal with additional filtering of these
    # properties.
    # Sticking with providing `country` is a way more easier.
