module Avantio

  # +Avantio::Booking+
  #
  # This class is responsible for wrapping the logic related to making a booking
  # to Avantio, parsing the response, and building the +Reservation+ object with the data
  # returned from their API.
  #
  # Usage
  #
  #   result = Avantio::Booking.new(credentials).book(stay_params)
  #   if result.success?
  #     process_reservation(result.value)
  #   else
  #     handle_error(result.error)
  #   end
  #
  # The +quote+ method returns a +Result+ object that, when successful, encapsulates the
  # resulting +Reservation+ object.
