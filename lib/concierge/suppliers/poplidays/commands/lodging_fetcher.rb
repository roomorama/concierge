    # +Poplidays::Commands::LodgingFetcher+
    #
    # This class is responsible for wrapping the logic related to getting
    # lodging details from Poplidays, parsing the response,
    # and building the +Result+ object with the raw data returned from their API.
    #
    # Usage
    #
    #   command = Poplidays::Commands::LodgingFetcher.new(credentials)
    #   result = command.call(property_id)
    #
    #   if result.success?
    #     result.value # Array of hashes
    #   end
    # The +call+ method returns a +Result+ object that, when successful,
    # encapsulates the array of +Hash+.
