module Poplidays

  # +Poplidays::Price+
  #
  # This class is responsible for performing price quotations for properties coming
  # from Poplidays, parsing the response and building the +Quotation+ object according
  # with the data returned by their API.
  #
  # Usage
  #
  #   result = Poplidays::Price.new.quote(stay_params)
  #   if result.success?
  #     process_quotation(result.value)
  #   else
  #     handle_error(result.error)
  #   end
  #
  # The price quotation API call is open - it requires no authentication. Therefore
  # no parameters are required to build this class.
  #
  # The +quote+ method returns a +Result+ object that, when successful, encapsulates
  # the resulting +Quotation+ object. Possible errors at this stage are:
  #
  # * +unrecognised_response+:  happens when the request was successful, but the format
  #                             of the response is not compatible to this class' expectations.
  # * +property_not_instant_bookable+: only properties that require no confirmation and have enabled prices
  #                                    (accessed without Poplidays call center)
  #                                    are supported at this moment.
