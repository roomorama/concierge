module Kigo

  # +Kigo::Client+
  #
  # This class is a convenience class for the smaller classes under +Kigo+.
  # For now, it allows the caller to get price quotations.
  #
  # Usage
  #
  #   quotation = Kigo::Client.new(credentials).quote(stay_params)
  #   if quotation.sucessful?
  #     # ...
  #   end
  #
  # For more information on how to interact with Kigo, check the project Wiki.
  # Note that this client interacts with the new Kigo Channels API. For
  # reference of the old Kigo API, check +Kigo::Legacy+.

    # Kigo, a generic error message is sent back to the caller, and the failure
    # is logged.
