  # +Roomorama::Client+
  #
  # This is a thin Roomorama client. Currently, it is supposed to support only
  # Roomorama's +publish+ API - that is, the +publish+ and +diff+ set of endpoints.
  #
  # This class, however, has no knowledge of such operations, and is able to perform
  # any +operation+. An operation is an object that responds to the following methods:
  #
  # * request_method - the HTTP request method to be performed.
  # * endpoint       - the API endpoint, a relative path to the root Roomorama API
  # * request_data   - the request data, if any, for the API call.
  #
  # Therefore, given an operation, this client is able to use the credentials given
  # on initialization to perform arbitrary API calls.
  #
  # Usage
  #
  #   operation = Roomorama::Client::Operations.publish(property)
  #   client = Roomorama::Client.new(access_token)
  #   client.perform(operation) # => Result<...>
  class Client

    # +Roomorama::Client::UnknownEnvironmentError+
    #
    # This error is raised when an unknown API environment is specified when
    # initialising the client.
