module API::Support

  # +API::Support::HTTPClient+
  #
  # This HTTP client is designed with error handling in mind. Networks are not
  # reliable, so code that performs any network related activity should be
  # prepared to handle failures gracefully.
  #
  # All requests performed through this class will have a default timeout of
  # 10 seconds. In addition to that, the return of every network related operation
  # from this class is an instance of the +Result+ object. This allows the caller
  # to determine if the call was successful and, in case it was not, handle
  # the error accordingly.
  #
  # Handled errors are:
  #
  #   * +:connection_timeout+ - happens if if takes more than 10 seconds to
  #                             get a response from the server.
  #   * +:connection_failed+  - when there is a problem connecting to the server.
  #   * +:ssl_error+          - when there was an SSL issue connecting to a server.
  #   * +:http_status_XXX+    - when the server returns a non-successful HTTP status (200, 201).
  #   * +:network_failure+    - general error category for any error network related failure.
  #
  # In all cases, the +Result+ object returned will have an error message associated
  # with the failure that can be logged somewhere for further analysis.
  #
  # Example
  #
  #   client = API::Support::HTTPClient.new("https://api.roomorama.com")
  #   result = client.get("/users")
  #   if result.success?
  #     process_response(result.value)
  #   else
  #     handle_error(result.error)
  #   end
