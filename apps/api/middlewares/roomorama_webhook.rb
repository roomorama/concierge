    # +API::Middlewares::RoomoramaWebhook+
    #
    # This middleware is responsible for making Concierge compliant with the
    # request/response format expected by Roomorama. Without it, Concierge
    # has a cleaner, more concise request and response formats. However,
    # at the present moment Roomorama requires a specific format for the webhooks
    # to work, and this middleware makes Concierge compatible with it without
    # having to change Concierge's defaults.
    #
    # The way that is accomplished is by validating incoming webhooks and transforming
    # them to Concierge's format. After Concierge is done processing, this middleware
    # will expand Concierge's response back to the format expected by the webhooks.
    #
    # In the future, when the format of Roomorama webhooks gets simpler, this
    # middlware could be entirely removed.
