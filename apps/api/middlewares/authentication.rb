    # +API::Middlewares::Authentication+
    #
    # Provides a simple authentication layer for Concierge.
    #
    # The Concierge API was primarily designed to be a hub for Roomorama's webhooks.
    # It implements a number of operations on behalf of suppliers, allowing all
    # all instant booking properties to run according to the webhooks flow.
    #
    # However, for security reasons, this application must not respond to any request.
    # Fortunately, the Webhooks functionality on Roomorama already supports some form
    # of request identification via the +Content-Signature+ HTTP header sent on every
    # request. This class implements a verification that the content on that header exists
    # and is valid, allowing us to ensure that the content comes from Roomorama and
    # was not modified along the way.
    #
    # This class will halt with an HTTP status +403+ if any of the folllowing is true:
    #
    # * the request method is not +POST+.
    # * there is no +Content-Type+ HTTP header.
    # * the signature does not match the payload.
    #
    # In case all of the above meet the expectations, the request is accepted and
    # processed. Exception to this rule are endpoints listed on the +WHITELIST+ constant,
    # where the same endpoint is reused across suppliers, and therefore no signature can
    # be enforced on them (since the secret changes per supplier.) Such endpoints should
    # be few and do no significant work.
    #
    # Note that each supplier partner has a different +Client Application+ on Roomorama.
    # That means that each supplier has its own secret, which makes sure that a supplier's
    # secret is only valid on operations on its own properties.
    class Authentication

      # +API::Middlewares::Authentication::Secrets+
      #
      # Internal class to manage the retrieval of application secrets for different
      # suppliers. The recognition of partner is performed using a URL matching
      # approach, since that is what is possible at this layer.
      #
      # Usage
      #
      #   secrets = API::Middlewares::Authentication::Secrets.new
      #   request_path = "/kigo/quote"
      #   secrets.for(request_path) # => X32842I
