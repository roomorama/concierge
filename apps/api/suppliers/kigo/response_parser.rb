  # +Kigo::ResponseParser+
  #
  # This class is responsible for decoding the response sent by Kigo's API
  # for different API calls.

  # Usage
  #
  #   parser = Kigo::ResponseParser.new
  #   parser.compute_pricing(request_params, response_body)
  #   # => #<Result error=nil value=Quotation>
  #
  # See documentation of this class instace methods for their description
  # and possible errors.

    #
    # Returns a +Result+ instance wrapping a +Quotation+ object
    # in case the response is successful. Possible errors that could
    # happen in this step are:
    #
    # +invalid_json_representation+: the response sent back is not a valid JSON.
    # +quote_call_failed+:           the response status is not +E_OK+.
    # +unrecognised_response+:       the response was successful, but the format cannot
    #                                be parsed.
