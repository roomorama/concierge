module API::Controllers

  # API::Controllers::Booking
  #
  # This module includes the logic for creating bookings for partner properties on their side.
  # Partner integrations are supposed to follow a certain protocol, detailed
  # below, so that parameter validation and error handling is automaticaly handled.
  #
  # Usage
  #
  #   class API::Controllers::Partner::Booking
  #     include API::Controllers::Booking
  #
  #     def create_booking(params)
  #       Partner::Client.new.book(params)
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # The only method this module expects to be implemented is a +create_booking+
  # method. The +params+ argument given to it is an instance of +API::Controllers::Params::Booking+.
  #
  # This method is only invoked in case validations were successful, meaning that partner
  # implementations need not to care about presence and format of expected parameters
  #
  # The +create_booking+ is expected to return a +Reservation+ object, always. See the documentation
  # of that class for further information.
  #
  # If the reservation is not successful, this method returns the errors declared in the returned
  # +Reservation+ object, and the return status is 503.
