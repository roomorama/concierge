  # Artificial checkout endpoint to be provided by Roomorama integrations based
  # on Concierge. With the flow currently in place, the +checkout_instant+ event
  # required by Roomorama is actually not necessary for Concierge. Therefore,
  # instead of performing more API calls to suppliers, we just return a successful
  # response, allowing the process to continue.
  #
  # This is only possible because clients (Roomorama or otherwise) are expected to
  # quote prices before moving with the booking process.
