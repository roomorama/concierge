  # +Web::Support::StatusCheck+
  #
  # The status check class is responsible for wrapping the behaviour of the
  # dashboard page, which indicates whether or not Concierge's API is live
  # and healthy.
  #
  # The definition of being alive and healthy is:
  #
  # * if the concierge endpoint was reached and a response sucess response
  #   is returned, then concierge is alive;
  # * if the response body accords to expectations, then concierge is healthy.
  #
  # Usage
  #
  #   check = Web::Support::StatusCheck.new
  #   check.alive?  # => true
  #   check.version # => "0.1.4"
  #
  # This class relies on the +/_ping+ endpoint of the Concierge API, which is
  # used by the load balancer for instance health check. In the future, more data
  # could be returned in that endpoint to allow a more detailed analysis.
