module Workers

  # +Workers::Router+
  #
  # This class is responsible for determining what operation, if any, should be
  # performed for a given property that was received from a supplier.
  #
  # Example
  #   property = Roomorama::Property.new("property1")
  #   # supplier API is called and +property+ is populated
  #   host = Host.last
  #   router = Workers::Router.new(host)
  #   router.dispatch(property) # => #<Roomorama::Client::Operations::Publish...>
  #
  # In case the property is unknown to Concierge, the router will generate
  # a +publish+ operation for it, meaning it will be made available on
  # Roomorama. In case the property was previously published, the difference
  # between the property and the last known version of it is calculated, and
  # the corresponding +Roomorama::Client::Operations::Diff+ operation is
  # returned.
  class Router

    # +Workers::Router::InvalidSerializedDataError+
    #
    # This error is raised when data in Concierge's database for a given property
    # cannot be loaded back into a +Roomorama::Property+ instance.

    # +property+ is expected to be an instance of +Roomorama::Property+. Returns:
    #
    # - an instance of +Roomorama::Client::Operations::Publish+ if the
    #   property needs to be published
    # - an instance of +Roomorama::Client::Operations::Diff+ if the
    #   property needs to be updated
    # - +nil+ in case there are no changes from the last known version
    #   of the given property.
