module Workers

  # +Workers::Router+
  #
  # This class is reponsible of determining what operation, if any, should be
  # performed for a given property that was received from a supplier.
  #
  # Example
  #   property = Romorama::Property.new("property1")
  #   # supplier API is called and +property+ is populated
  #   host = Host.last
  #   router = Workers::Router.new(host)
  #   router.dispatch(property) # => #<Roomorama::Client::Operations::Publish...>
  #
  # In case the property is unknown to Concierge, the router will generate
  # a +publish+ operation for it, meaning it will be made available on
  # Roomorama. In case the property was previously published, the difference
  # between the property and the last known version of it is calculated, and
  # the corresponding +Roomorama::Client::Operations::Diff+ operation is
  # returned.
  class Router
    attr_reader :host

    # host - a +Host+ instance, representing the host that owns the properties
    #        that are going to be routed.
    def initialize(host)
      @host = host
    end

    # +property+ is expected to be an instance of +Roomorama::Property+. Returns:
    #
    # - an instance of +Roomorama::Client::Operations::Publish+ if the
    #   property needs to be published
    # - an instance of +Roomorama::Client::Operations::Diff+ if the
    #   property needs to be updated
    # - +nil+ in case there are no changes from the last known version
    #   of the given property.

      existing = concierge_property_for(property)

      if existing
        diff = calculate_diff(existing, property)
