class Workers::OperationRunner

  # +Workers::OperationRunner::Publish+
  #
  # This class is responsible for running a publish operation. That encompasses
  # the following steps:
  #
  # * make an API call to Roomorama to publish the property
  # * persist the property on Concierge's database with the given data.
  #
  # In case the API call fails, the property should not be persisted.
  # As +Roomorama::Client+ uses +Concierge::HTTPClient+ under the hood, the
  # failure is stored in the process context and can later be analysed
  # to understand the reason of the occurrence.
