module Workers

  # +Workers::Scheduler+
  #
  # This class is responsible for checking which background workers should be run
  # (i.e., the +next_run_at+ column is either +nil+ or in a time in the past),
  # and enqueue the correspondent message to the queue to start the
  # synchronisation process.
  #
  # This scheduler logs its work using a +logger+ instance given on initialization.
  # By default, its output is placed on +log/scheduler.log+. Activity on which
  # hosts were synchronised can be checked from there.
  class Scheduler

    # the logger classes below aim to provide a unique interface for generating
    # log messages for host and supplier-related workers. The methods expected to
    # be implemented are:
    #
    # +initialize(worker)+
    # Initializes the logger, receiving an instance of +BackgroundWorker+
    #
    # +to_s+
    # Returns a +String+ with the scheduler message to be logged.

    # +Workers::Scheduler::HostLogger+
    #
    # Generates log messages for host background workers being scheduled.

    # being scheduled.
