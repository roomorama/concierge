module Workers::Comparison

  # +Workers::Comparison::Unit+
  #
  # Performs a comparison between two sets of units, useful when comparing
  # multi-unit properties. Given the two sets of +Roomorama::Unit+ instances,
  # this class is able to produce a list of units to be created, updated and
  # deleted so that one set can be transformed into the other.
