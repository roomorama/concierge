module Workers::Comparison

  # +Workers::Comparison::Property+
  #
  # This is the main comparison class of the classes under +Concierge+. It takes two
  # instances of +Roomorama::Property+ which are supposed to be successive representations
  # of the same property, and is able to produce a +Roomorama::Diff+ that, when applied
  # can transform one representation to the other
  #
  # Usage
  #
  #   original = Roomorama::Property.load({ ... })
  #   new      = Roomorama::Property.load({ ... })
  #
  #   diff = Workers::Comparison::Property.new(original, new).extract_diff
  #   # => #<Roomorama::Diff ...>
  #
  # This class is capable of identifying differences on associations as well -
  # property images and units (as well as unit images, in turn)

    # +Workers::Comparison::Unit+ and +Workers::Comparison::Attributes+. Check
    # the their documentation to check how the difference is calculated.
