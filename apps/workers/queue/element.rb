class Workers::Queue

  # +Workers::Queue::Element+
  #
  # This class is wraps the concept of one element that can be added to the workers
  # queue. All elements must follow the standard implemented by this class, so
  # that worker processing is made simple due to the unified nature of the
  # messages that are enqueued.
  #
  # Elements consist of:
  #
  # +operation+ - an identifier of the operation to be performed by the worker.
  # +data+      - a Hash of arguments necessary to carry out the operation.
  #
  # Usage
  #
  #   element = Workers::Queue::Element.new(operation: "sync", data: { host_id: 2 })
  #   element.serialize => "{ \"operation\": \"sync\", \"data\": { \"host_id\": 2 }"
