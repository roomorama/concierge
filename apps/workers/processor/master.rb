class Workers::Processor

  # +Workers::Processor::Master+
  #
  # This class is responsible to coordinate a set of worker processes that process
  # messages from the SQS queue (+Workers::Queue+), and wait for more messages.
  # It is able to:
  #
  # * prefork a given number of worker processes, given on initialization
  # * monitor child processes and recreate them if they die.
  # * clean up worker processes if the master is killed
  # * wrap worker process so that running synchronisation processes will not be aborted.
  #
  # Check the documentation of the methods and the logic for an understanding
  # of how this tasks are accomplished.
  #
  # Usage
  #
  #   master = Workers::Processor::Master.new(prefork: 5)
  #   master.load! # => creates 5 children processes
  #
  # Worker processes can be identified by their name. The master process
  # will be named +Roomorama/Concierge Processor::Master+, whereas worker
  # processes will be named +Roomorama/Concierge Processor::Worker N+, where
  # +N+ is the worker number.
