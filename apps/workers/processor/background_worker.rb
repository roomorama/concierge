class Workers::Processor

  #
  # Background workers can be of two types: associated with a host (regular
  # workers), or associated directly with a supplier (for suppliers declared
  # as +aggregated+.) The corresponding instance of +Host+ and +Supplier+,
  # respectively, is passed to code listening via +Concierge::Announcer+.

    #

    # that is, it does not respond to the +to_h+ method.

    #
    # +supplier+
    # determines the supplier associated with a run of a background worker.
    # For host-associated workers, the supplier is defined as the supplier
    # of the associated hosts; for aggregated-type suppliers, the supplier
    # is just defined as the supplier directly connected to the background
    # worker via the +supplier_id+ foreign key.

    # the list of arguments to be passed to code listening on the related
    # event via +Concierge::Announcer+.
