  #
  # Background workers can be of two types: associated with a host (regular
  # workers), or associated directly with a supplier (for suppliers declared
  # as +aggregated+.) The corresponding instance of +Host+ and +Supplier+,
  # respectively, is passed to code listening via +Concierge::Announcer+.

    # determines the supplier associated with a run of a background worker.

    # of the associated hosts; for aggregated-type suppliers, the supplier
    # is just defined as the supplier directly connected to the background
    # worker via the +supplier_id+ foreign key.
