module Workers

  # +Workers::Synchronisation+
  #
  # Organizes the synchronisation process for a given host from supplier.
  # It is able to route processed property to the adequate operation
  # (through the use of +Workers::Router+), as well as disabling properties
  # that were published before but are no longer contained in the list
  # of properties for that host.
  #
  # Usage
  #
  #   host = Host.last
  #   sync = Workers::Synchronisation.new(host)
  #
  #   # supplier API is called, raw data is fetched
  #   properties = fetch_properties
  #   properties.each do |attributes|
  #     sync.start(attributes[:identifier]) {
  #       property = Roomorama::Property.new(attributes[:identifier])
  #       # property object is built
  #
  #       Result.new(property)
  #     }
  #   end
  #
  #   sync.finish! # => non-processed properties are deleted at the end of the process.

    # Indicates that the property with the given +identifier+ is being synchronised.

    # This method wraps all the common logic related to property synchronising. It
    # initializes +Concierge.context+ to an empty context, and collects data about
    # the processing of the identifier given.
    #
    # This method *must* be called with a block which returns a +Result+ instance
    # wrapping a +Roomorama::Property+ object, or a failure, if there were any.
    #
    # Possible scenarios:
    #
    # * the property returned from the block given is valid. It might then be
    #   published or updated, depending on whether or not there were changes
    #   (see +Workers::Router+)
    #
    # * the property returned from the block given fails to meet minimum validations.
    #   In this case, the context is augmented, and an +ExternalError+ is created.
    #
    # * the +Result+ returned by the block given indicates an error while processing
    #   the property. In this case, the external error is also persisted. The caller
    #   is encouraged to have augmented +Concierge.context+ with meaningful information
    #   to aid debugging.

    #
    # Note that if one of the properties processed failed (i.e., returned a
    # non-successful +Result+), then this process will not disable all properties
    # on Roomorama (rationale: if a supplier faces an intermittent issue during
    # the synchronisation process, we do not want to disable all properties
    # as a consequence of that.)
