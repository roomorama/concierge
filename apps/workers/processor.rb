module Workers

  # +Workers::Processor+
  #
  # This class wraps the logic of processing one message read from the +Concierge::Queue+
  # (backed by an SQS queue) class. By default (as specified by +Concierge::Queue::Element+),
  # each message is a JSON-encoded string containing two fields:
  #
  # +operation+ - the identifier of the operation to be performed. Only +sync+ is supported
  #               at the moment.
  # +data+      - a map of values to be used as arguments of the given +operation+. For the
  #               +sync+ operation, this map contains only one key, +host_id+, the ID of the
  #               host that is to be synchronised.
  #
  # Example
  #
  #   queue = Concierge::Queue.new(credentials)
  #   queue.poll do |message|
  #     Workers::Processor.new(message).process!
  #   end

    # Error raised when an operation read from the queue, given to +Workers::Processor+
    # is unrecognised.

    # to trigger the +sync.<supplier_name>+ event on +Concierge::Announcer+.
    # If there is an implementation listening for this event, it will be
    # processed.
    #
    # Returns a +Result+ instance with any potential error.
